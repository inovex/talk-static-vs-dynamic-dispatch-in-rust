# Talk - Static vs dynamic dispatch in rust

This repo contains the contents of my talk about static and dynamic dispatch in
rust. These are two different implementation of
[polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)
in programming language.

The talk is done without slides, just with a terminal.  It walks trough the
following files and commands:

* [INTRO.md](talk/INTRO.md)
* [main.rs](main.rs)
* `./main-rust`
* [main.cpp](main.cpp)
* `./main-cpp`
* `make nm`
* [dis-cpp](dis-cpp)
* [dis-rust](dis-rust)
* [OUTRO.md](talk/OUTRO.md)
